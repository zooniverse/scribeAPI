# Scribe 

[Scribe](http://scribeproject.github.io/) is a framework for crowdsourcing the transcription of text-based documents, particularly documents that are not well suited for Optical Character Recognition. It is a collaboration between [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/) and [The New York Public Library Labs](http://labs.nypl.org/) with generous support from [The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), Office of Digital Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh).

## Example Projects

We are launching Scribe with three very different projects by [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/) and [The New York Public Library](http://www.nypl.org/):

* [Emigrant City (NYPL)](http://emigrantcity.nypl.org)
* [Measuring the Anzacs (Zooniverse)](http://measuringtheanzacs.org)
* [Old Weather: Whaling (Zooniverse)](http://whaling.oldweather.org)

## Changes to get running on Heroku (July 2017)

### Software versions

* There seem to be compatibility problems with Node versions greater than 6. I edited `package.json` to pin Node at 6.11.1, as recommended by the [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support). You might need to [use n](https://github.com/tj/n) to install and activate a specific version of Node for development.

* Heroku [no longer supports](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby-support) 2.1.* versions of Ruby. I changed Gemfile to specify `ruby '2.2.7'`, which is the earliest supported version. I also changed `.ruby-version` accordingly.

* MLab databases now use MongoDB 3, but Mongoid 4 doesn't seem able to authenticate with MongoDB 3 urls. So I changed the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` to set Mongoid at 5.2.1.

* The mongoid change also meant I had to update `mongoid-rspec`, `rspec-rails`, `bson`, and `origin`. I also removed the `bson` requirement from `moped`.

### Code changes

* In `config/mongoid.yml` changed `sessions` to `clients`.
* In `app/models/classification.rb` changed `find_and_modify` mthod to `find_one_and_update`.

### Environment variables -- Development

This isn't really mentioned in the [ScribeAPI wiki](https://github.com/zooniverse/scribeAPI/wiki):

* Create a file in the root of the project called `.env`.
* Use `rake secret` to create a secret key.
* Add `DEVISE_SECRET_TOKEN=yournewkey` to `.env`.
* Repeat to add `SECRET_KEY_BASE_TOKEN=anothernewkey` to `.env`.
* To specify the name of the Mongo database you want to create, set `MONGO_DB=yourdbname`
* If you're going to start up the Puma web server (see below), add `RACK_ENV=development` and `PORT=3000`

Also add your OAUTH keys to `.env` as mentioned [in the wiki](https://github.com/zooniverse/scribeAPI/wiki/Setting-up-OAuth-%26-Deploying).

### Deployment to Heroku

After creating your Heroku app and database as described [in the wiki](https://github.com/zooniverse/scribeAPI/wiki/Setting-up-OAuth-%26-Deploying):

* Add `DEVISE_SECRET_TOKEN` and `SECRET_KEY_BASE_TOKEN` to Heroku's environment variables, eg: `heroku config:set "DEVISE_SECRET_TOKEN=yournewkey"`
* Add your `MONGOLAB_URI` and OAUTH credentials as described in the wiki.

The information about buildpacks in the wiki is out of date. Ignore the section about `BUILDPACK_URL` but before you deploy to Heroku run the following commands:

* `heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs`
* `heroku buildpacks:add --index 2 heroku/ruby`

The index values are important as Node needs to be built first, otherwise the Ruby build will fail complaining about Browserify.

### Procfile

The original repo had a non-functional `procfile` -- capitalisation matters to Heroku, so I've renamed it `Procfile`. Heroku recommends running the [Puma web server](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4#webserver), so I've just followed their instructions on what to include in the `Procfile`. If you want to test the config in your development environment, make sure you set the `RACK_ENV` and `PORT` values in your `.env` file and then use Foreman -- `foreman start`.
