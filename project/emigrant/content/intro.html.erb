## A Brief Introduction to Emigrant City

### Our Goal

To extract structured data from over 6,000 handwritten mortgage and bond ledgers from the Emigrant Savings Bank records.

To divide the labor -- and to help ensure accuracy -- we've broken the work into 3 free-standing tasks. These tasks follow a sequence, but they can be performed independently (feel free to focus on the one you enjoy best).

### Task 1: Mark

Here you'll be identifying various pieces of information on the page. You won't be typing, just drawing boxes. This helps plot a route for the transcribers in Task 2. You may see existing marks left by other users. Just pick up where they left off.

### Task 2: Transcribe

Here you'll type out the words and numbers inside the fields marked by your fellow volunteers. Heads up: there may be some tricky handwriting to decipher! But don't worry, we'll get these transcribed multiple times to ensure accuracy, so give it your best shot and move on.

### Task 3: Verify

Every document will be transcribed several times by multiple volunteers, and our software looks for agreement among them. If a field has been transcribed consistently and independently three times, it has reached "consensus" and is added to the final data set. If there are conflicting entries, those are queued up in the Verify task, where you can vote on the most accurate transcription, or, if needed, add your own.
