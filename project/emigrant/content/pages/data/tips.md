## Tips & Tricks

### Search
* **Use quotation marks to search for full phrases.**  
[Search results](http://emigrantcity.nypl.org/?#/data/browse?keyword=margaret%20armstrong) for Margaret Armstrong will display records with Margaret and/or Armstrong in the record. However, [search results](http://emigrantcity.nypl.org/?#/data/browse?keyword=%22margaret%20armstrong%22) for "Margaret Armstrong" display only records where the full name "Margaret Armstrong" appear.

* **Capitalization does not matter in search.**  
"MARGARET," "margaret," and "Margaret" entered into the search box, will yield the same results.

* **Consider abbreviations.**  
We asked users to transcribe exactly what they see written on the records including abbreviations. The word Brooklyn may appear as “BKLYN” in one record and “Brooklyn” in another.

### Reading a Record  
The data in these records have been communally created through the Emigrant City participatory project. See the <a href="/#/intro">Intro</a> for more information on the steps for publicly and collaboratively creating this resource. As you'll see below, we've tried to be transparent about the collaborative nature of this resource with notations about confidence and status.

* **Best Data versus All Data**  
A record's best data consolidates and lightly cleans all the fields for that record. During the transcription process, the same field may have been marked multiple times and made it all the way through the Scribe work-flow resulting in duplications of that unique field. Best data consolidates these duplications. There is also minimal formatting cleanup. For instance, in Best Data Amount Loaned is represented as a dollar amount rather than just a number.

* **What is the Source Metadata?**  
This page contains technical details related to the transcription interface and includes a link to the high res version of the record page.

* **What is the confidence field?**  
Record fields were created through contributions from many users. A result, we can gauge how confident we are about each field's accuracy. Fields with an 100% confidence ratings are fields for which every transcription was the same. Lower confidence ratings mean that there was disagreement on how best to transcribe a field.

* **What is a field's status?**  
The status of each field is displayed. This corresponds with where the field's transcription is in the work-flow of the project be it Mark, Transcribe, or Verify.

* **What are distinct transcriptions?**  
Each field is annotated with the number of distinct transcriptions they have received during the project's run. A distinct transcription of 1 means everyone transcribed the same thing for that field.

* **High res images of the records**  
Emigrant City is a project and resource to browse historic mortgage records from the Emigrant Savings Bank. You may view and/or download high resolution images of these records on our Digital Collections site. If you would like to view the high resolution version of a record, navigate to the Source Metadata tab and click on the Page Uri Link. A high resolution image of the record's full page will open in a new tab.

<!--* **Why are there field repetitions in this record? Why is a field missing from this record?**
  You may notice that for some records, fields appear multiple times. Sometimes multiple different fields are associated with one record. For example, [Record 3758](http://emigrantcity.nypl.org/#/data/browse/56b109ac7061755afbfdbb00) has two mortgagors listed: "Eunice R. Waterbury" and "Eloise B. Crothers."-->

* **Which fields appear?**  
This project intended to create a index to enable further discovery. With this project, the goal is to create an index of the bond and mortgage records to enable further discovery and use. We’ve worked with experts on the material to scope the data collected to fields which appear with greater regularity across documents: Record Date, Record Number, Mortgager Name, Street Address, Amount Loaned, Valuation, and Dimension & Description. Collecting and verifying these fields from the records creates resource that opens up the search of these materials. However, the data being gathered is not an exhaustive. Rather than creating a complete transcription of each record, the transcribed fields create an index to give some toeholds for future reference and querying of these rich materials which previously were largely invisible and difficult to search.  

* **How often is the data refreshed?**  
Contributions are still actively being made to Emigrant City. The records available in browse and download will be refreshed weekly with these new contributions. (You can still contribute to the project by <a href="/#/transcribe">transcribing</a> and <a href="/#/verify">verifying</a> data.)

<!-- * **What geographic areas are covered?** -->
<!-- Will including this confuse? In this mortgage, the mortgage date appears three times. The project is structured to allow for multiple fields on one page. Multiple users marked the same field which resulted in the same date, “Mar. 23/03,” being transcribed several times.-->
