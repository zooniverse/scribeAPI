In this task, you'll perform quality control on the transcriptions. From those provided, select the transcription that most accurately matches the information as it was written - including whether or not a currency symbol or other punctuation was written. For example, if a dollar sign was printed on the form (but not written), the best transcription does not include a dollar sign. If a comma appears in the value as written, the best transcription includes a comma.

If multiple transcriptions are valid, choose the first one. If none appear correct, you may choose to enter your own. If the selected region isn't appropriate for the prompt, click "Bad region."

Once a consensus has been achieved, we'll accept the transcription as accurate and add the value to the index.
