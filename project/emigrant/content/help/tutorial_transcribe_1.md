#Transcribe

Transcribe the written text exactly as you see it, including whether or not a currency symbol or other punctuation was written. For example, if a dollar sign was printed on the form (but not written), do not transcribe the dollar sign. If a comma appears in the value as written, transcribe the comma.

For additional help and sample transcriptions, each transcription prompt has an "Need some help" button providing field specific context.

If the text is hard to read, give it your best shot and keep going. Keep in mind: each mark will be transcribed by multiple volunteers and quality controlled in the Verify task.

If the information is indecipherable, mark it as Illegible and move on to the next entry. If there is no information to transcribe or if the selected region isn't appropriate for the prompt, select Bad region and move on to the next entry.
