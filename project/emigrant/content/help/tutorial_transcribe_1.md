#Transcribe

Transcribe the text exactly as you see it, including punctuation. For additional help and sample transcriptions, each transcription prompt has an "Need some help" button providing field specific context.

If the text is hard to read, give it your best shot and keep going. Keep in mind: each mark will be transcribed by multiple volunteers and quality controlled in the Verify task.

If the information is indecipherable, mark it as Illegible and move on to the next entry. If there is no information to transcribe, select Bad region and move on to the next entry.
