# Task
Your task is to identify specific pieces of information in a series of digitized bank records. Sometimes the record, or a portion of it, is obscured by an image or note pasted on the page. 

If the entire record is obscured or if the page is blank, select the "Bad Page" button in the right hand pane and hit the next button to move to the next record.
