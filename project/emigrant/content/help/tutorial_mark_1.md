# Task
Your task is to identify specific pieces of information in a series of digitized bank records. Sometimes the record, or a portion of it, is obscured by an image or note pasted on the page or the page contains information other than that of an individual mortgage record.

If the entire record is obscured, the page is blank, or the page contains information other than an individual mortgage record select the "Bad Page" button in the right hand pane and hit the next button to move to the next record.
