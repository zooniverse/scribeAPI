#Hi!

Your task is to identify fields in a series of bank records. You'll be working with digitized pages from the Bank's record books. Typically, each page has two pages. Sometimes, one or both of the records are obscured by another image or an insert on the page. If there's an issue preventing you from reading the records or if there is no information recorded on the page, select the "Bad Page" button in the right hand pane.

Use the menu on the right to select a field (e.g. "Record Date"). Then, use your mouse to draw a box on the image around each place that the field appears. As an aid, the fields are color coded. All the boxes for that field will appear in the same color. For additional, field specific guidance select the help buttons next to each field label.

You may see existing rectangles on the page. If this is the case, someone has already marked the field and there's no need to mark an area twice.

You can manipulate the digitized pages with tools on the left hand side of the screen. Here you'll find the zoom tool and a mark toggle. 

The marks created in this task identify the fields to be transcribed in the next task phase.
