#Help with Verification

Choose the transcription that most accurately matches the information as it was written - including whether or not a currency symbol or other punctuation was written. For example, if a dollar sign was printed on the form (but not written), the best transcription does not include a dollar sign. If a comma appears in the value as written, the best transcription includes a comma.

If multiple transcriptions are valid, choose the first one.

If the selected region isn't appropriate for the prompt, click "Bad region."
