# Valuation  

Some records include valuations comprised of an assessment date and a dollar values. Valuations can be of the land, the building, and the total, or a combination of the three.

Valuations can sometimes be difficult to find. These are hand-written and are typically found at or near the bottom of the record. If there are multiple valuations, transcribe the most recent. Transcribe the fields as they appear.

Example: "1879 November Valuation of premises $1200"
