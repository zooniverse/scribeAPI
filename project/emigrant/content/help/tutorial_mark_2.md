# Fields

Use the menu on the right to select a field (e.g. "Record Number"). Then, use your mouse to draw a box on the image around each place that the field appears. As an aid, the fields and their corresponding marks are color coded.

<div class="video-wrapper">
  <video width="445" height="113.18" loop autoplay src="/images/mark_task2.mp4"></video>
</div>

For additional, field specific guidance select the question marks next to each field label.
