# Making Your Mark

To mark a field, click and drag the mark around the desired area. Once you have the mark around the area you want it, select the "Done" check-box. Once you've clicked on "Done," your mark is saved. You can close your browser window or move on to a new task and all your work will be saved.  

If you'd like to remove one of your marks, click on it and then on the red delete button in the upper-right corner of the mark.
