    <p>Transcribe the written text exactly as you see it, including whether or not a currency symbol or other punctuation was written. For example, if a dollar sign was printed on the form (but not written), do not transcribe the dollar sign. If a comma or dash appears in the value as written, transcribe the comma or dash. If a number appears as superscript, transcribe it as a decimal, see Sample Two for an example of this.</p>
