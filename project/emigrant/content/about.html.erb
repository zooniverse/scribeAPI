### About Emigrant Bank

[Emigrant Bank](https://www.emigrant.com/Information/aboutus/AboutUs.jsp) was founded in 1850 by members of the Irish Emigrant society to serve the needs of the Irish immigrant community in New York. In its early history, the bank grew to become the seventh largest bank in the nation, and it made major investments in the growth of New York City by underwriting loans for such important initiatives as the construction of St. Patrick’s Cathedral and a public works project that ultimately became Central Park. In 1995, Emigrant Bank generously donated to The New York Public Library [extensive archival records](http://archives.nypl.org/mss/925) that are valuable historical and genealogical resources documenting the lives of immigrant families. The Library microfilmed the entire collection and compiled a [detailed finding aid](http://archives.nypl.org/uploads/documents/documentation/collection_1837_mss925-extra.pdf) that outlines the full scope of the Emigrant Savings Bank records. This heavily trafficked collection is housed in the Manuscripts and Archives Division. Though, users primarily encounter it through the Irma and Paul Milstein Division of United States History, Local History and Genealogy division of the Library.

### Digitization and Public Transcription: Bringing New Materials to Light

While a portion of the Bank's records have been digitized and poured over by generations of genealogists, the real estate materials appear to be largely unknown and underutilized. These include, most notably, mortgage and bond records: loans taken out (we suspect mostly by relatively new immigrants) to buy properties and to mortgage existing real estate (an essential step in moving up through New York's economic strata).

The goal of the _Emigrant City_ transcription initiative is to produce structured, building-level records for over 7,000 digitized mortgages. Building this keyword searchable index of names and mortgage details should be of tremendous use to genealogists and will provide an intriguing historical data set for digital humanists and researchers. Additionally, because these property records include detailed geographic information, they will contribute to spatial data aggregation efforts around the Library's new historical mapping platform, the [NYC Space/Time Directory](http://spacetime.nypl.org/). In addition, we are encouraging general access to the collection by making high resolution images of these materials available via the [NYPL Digital Collections](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/emigrant-savings-bank-records#/?tab=about) website.

This is not the first time the collection has garnered attention from crowdsourcing efforts. An Ancestry.com project has successfully digitized and indexed the collection’s Index Book, Test Books, Deposit-Account Ledger, and Transfer, Signature, and Test Books. The Library’s project will contribute significantly to the existing accessibility efforts supporting the use of this collection and enable further scholarship and genealogical investigations into the wealth of information contained within.

### How Transcription Works

Many transcription projects deal with deciphering and typing free-flowing text from digitized pages (say, from letters or diaries). This project has a different focus. The goal here is to produce a _structured_ data set extracted from historical records that are themselves highly structured. This involves identifying key fields on the page and then transcribing the text from those fields. For complex, age-worn documents written in 19th century script, this is a tall order. So we've devised a division of labor.

In _Emigrant City_, transcription is broken into three free-standing tasks: marking, transcribing, and verifying. These tasks follow a sequence of work, but they can be performed independently of one another. One person may prefer the work of marking: identifying fields on the page and drawing boxes around them. This work provides a structure for the document that facilitates the actual typing

out of text in the transcription task. This task too can be done in isolation, benefiting from the clearly placed data entry fields provided by previous volunteers in the marking stage. Lastly, there is the verification stage. This task is about ensuring the quality of the work done in the marking and transcribing stages.

Regarding quality, the thing to keep in mind is this: every document will be marked and transcribed several times by multiple volunteers. The software running this project runs an algorithm that looks for agreement among the marks and transcriptions provided by disparate volunteers. If a field has been marked and transcribed consistently by several users, it has reached "consensus" and is added to the final data set. If there are conflicting entries, those are queued up for the verification task, in which users can vote on the most accurate transcription, and make further corrections if needed.

### About the Software
_Emigrant City_ is one of the first projects to be built on an open-source framework called [_Scribe_](http://scribeproject.github.io/) built by NYPL Labs and Zooniverse with generous support National Endowment for the Humanities. Scribe is modeled on the idea, described above, of broken-down task flows and multi-user consensus, and is geared toward transcription projects that aim to produce structured data sets. It is designed to be highly configurable and able to handle a wide range of document types with varying structures.
