Select the type of weather description, then draw a rectangle around each location of that type.


Wind force (speed) and direction and an impression of the weather are found in most every log entry.

Force descriptions are indexed to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/beaufort.html">Beaufort Scale</a>
and direction is given in compass points (N, NW, NxW, NNW for example). Measurements of temperature and barometric pressure are rare in these logs, so please be sure to mark them if you find them!
